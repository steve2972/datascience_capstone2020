> **The Effects of Spatial Agglomeration on Relative Net Profitability: a prospective look at Seoul’s retail market sector using machine learning**

# Introduction
## Background

Walking down a busy city street, one might notice a common but peculiar phenomenon concerning the stores around him or her. It would seem as if cafes, restaurants, or competing retail stores in general were gathered together in a particular area, and less so in other areas. This economic phenomenon, called spatial agglomeration, is in part explained by Hotelling’s Model of Spatial Competition. However, the existence of such clusters within competing companies also begs the question whether such companies earn more on average than their counterparts that are less clustered together.

With more than 15 million tourists visiting in 2019 alone, Seoul, a sprawling metropolis located at the heart of South Korea, is home to a number of popular attractions for both foreigners and Koreans alike. Furthermore, market competition in the city led to the congregation of some markets in certain neighborhoods. This in turn caused these neighborhoods to become famous for a particular set of goods(i.e. Mapo for its galbi [Korean beef ribs], Itaewon for foreign goods, Dongdaemun for apparel, etc.). Such localized specialization defines much of Seoul’s commerce today, especially among the country’s younger populace. 

Stakeholders looking to open new businesses will often dispute which part of a city they should open in. The rise of localities in Seoul has made this decision process harder since entrepreneurs now have to decide whether to open business in a fiercely competitive neighborhood or risk defaulting in a less famous location. Thus, this research will use Seoul’s retail markets to assess whether clustering markets holds an inherent economic advantage over individual markets.
